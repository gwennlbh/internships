  abstract: 'We describe an iterative procedure for optimizing policies, with guaranteed
    monotonic improvement. By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified
    procedure, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization
    (TRPO). This algorithm is similar to natural policy gradient methods and is effective
    for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments
    demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated
    robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images
    of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory,
    TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.'

  abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging
    problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing
    existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods
    is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art
    deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard
    benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make
    reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter
    standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether
    improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we
    investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques,
    and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and
    results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make
    future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how
    to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming
    from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.

  abstract: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm has demonstrated excellent
    performance in many fields, and it is considered as a simple version of TRPO (Trust
    Region Policy Optimization) algorithm. However, the ratio clipping operation in
    PPO may not always effectively enforce the trust region constraints, this can
    be a potential factor affecting the stability of the algorithm. In this paper,
    we propose Simple Policy Optimization (SPO) algorithm, which introduces a novel
    clipping method for KL divergence between the old and current policies. Extensive
    experimental results in Atari 2600 environments indicate that, compared to the
    mainstream variants of PPO, SPO achieves better sample efficiency, extremely low
    KL divergence, and higher policy entropy, and is robust to the increase in network
    depth or complexity. More importantly, SPO maintains the simplicity of an unconstrained
    first-order algorithm. Code is available at https://github.com/MyRepositories-hub/Simple-Policy-Optimization.

  serial-number:
    arxiv: 1904.07854v2
  abstract: The combination of deep neural network models and reinforcement learning
    algorithms can make it possible to learn policies for robotic behaviors that directly
    read in raw sensory inputs, such as camera images, effectively subsuming both
    estimation and control into one model. However, real-world applications of reinforcement
    learning must specify the goal of the task by means of a manually programmed reward
    function, which in practice requires either designing the very same perception
    pipeline that end-to-end reinforcement learning promises to avoid, or else instrumenting
    the environment with additional sensors to determine if the task has been performed
    successfully. In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for
    manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from
    a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited
    queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine
    whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting
    labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide
    the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the
    states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for
    learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We evaluate our method on
    real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the observations consist of images
    viewed by the robot's camera. In our experiments, our method effectively learns
    to arrange objects, place books, and drape cloth, directly from images and without
    any manually specified reward functions, and with only 1-4 hours of interaction
    with the real world.

  abstract: Software developers reuse third-party packages that are hosted in package
    registries. At build time, a package manager resolves and fetches the direct and
    indirect dependencies of a project. Most package managers also generate a lockfile,
    which records the exact set of resolved dependency versions. Lockfiles are used
    to reduce build times; to verify the integrity of resolved packages; and to support
    build reproducibility across environments and time. Despite these beneficial features,
    developers often struggle with their maintenance, usage, and interpretation. In
    this study, we unveil the major challenges related to lockfiles, such that future
    researchers and engineers can address them. We perform the first comprehensive
    study of lockfiles across 7 popular package managers, npm, pnpm, Cargo, Poetry,
    Pipenv, Gradle, and Go. First, we highlight the wide variety of design decisions
    that package managers make, regarding the generation process as well as the content
    of lockfiles. Next, we conduct a qualitative analysis based on semi-structured
    interviews with 15 developers. We capture first-hand insights about the benefits
    that developers perceive in lockfiles, as well as the challenges they face to
    manage these files. Following these observations, we make 5 recommendations to
    further improve lockfiles, for a better developer experience.

  abstract: In this study, we compare the performance of the new-generation communication
    protocol Zenoh with the widely-used MQTT, Kafka, and DDS. Two performance indexes
    were evaluated, including throughput and latency. A brief description of each
    protocol is introduced in this article. The experiment configuration and the testing
    scenarios are described in detail. The results show that Zenoh outperforms the
    others with impressive performance numbers.

  abstract: The design and control of lower-limb rehabilitation robots for patients
    after a stroke has gained significant attention. This paper presents the dynamic
    analysis and control of a 3-degrees-of-freedom lower-limb rehabilitation robot
    using combined position–force control based on the force feed-forward and compensative
    gravity proportional derivative methods. In the lower-limb rehabilitation robot,
    the interaction force between the patient with the joints and links of the robot
    is uncertain and nonlinear due to the disturbance effect of Coriolis force, centrifugal
    force, gravitational force, and friction force. During recovery stages, the forces
    exerted by the patient’s lower limbs are also considered disturbances. Therefore,
    to meet the quality requirements in using the rehabilitation robot with different
    recovery stages of patient training, combining position control and force control
    is essential. In this paper, we proposed a combination of proportional–derivative
    gravity compensation motion control and force feed-forward control to form an
    advanced combined controller (position–force feed-forward control—PFFC) for a
    3 DOF lower-limb functional rehabilitation robot. The forces can be sensed using
    a 3-axis force sensor. In addition, the robot’s position parameters are also measured
    by encoders. The control algorithm is implemented on the STM32F4 Discovery board.
    A verified test of the proposed control method is shown in the experiments, showing
    the good performance of the system.
